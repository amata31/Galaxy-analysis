# Galaxy Analysis – P170+20

This repository contains data analysis scripts developed to study the high-redshift galaxy candidate **P170+20**, evaluated as a potential gravitational lensing system.

The project was carried out during a research internship at the Gemini Observatory and focuses on extracting physical information from spectroscopic data using reproducible data analysis workflows.

## 🚀 Project Objective

To process and analyze spectroscopic observations in order to:

- Rescaling spectroscopic data to match photometric reference points
- Combining multi-source observational datasets
- Resampling spectra into uniform wavelength bins
- Comparing observational data against galaxy template models
- Evaluating plausible physical scenarios through model fitting
- Evaluate the gravitational lensing hypothesis
- Extract information from spectral features

Although astrophysics-driven, the workflow follows a structured data science pipeline:

data ingestion → preprocessing → modeling → parameter estimation → visualization
